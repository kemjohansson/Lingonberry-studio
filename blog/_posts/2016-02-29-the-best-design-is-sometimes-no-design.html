excerpt: "I have been very fortunate to fall in love twice this early spring. (Is
  it Spring? It's Spring right?) I appreciate them both for their simplicity, tone
  and ingenuity. They have also made me reevaluate that sometimes less really is more.
  I am talking about my two new favorite apps of course. In an age where we are inundated
  with so many pixels, it is a breath of fresh air when something comes along so opposite
  of that.\r\n\r\n"

<p>I have been very fortunate to fall in love twice this early spring. (Is it Spring? It's Spring right?) I appreciate them both for their simplicity, tone and ingenuity. They have also made me reevaluate that sometimes less really is more. I am talking about my two new favorite apps of course. In an age where we are inundated with so many pixels, it is a breath of fresh air when something comes along so opposite of that.</p>

<p>My first big crush this year is <a href="https:&#47;&#47;digit.co&#47;" target="_blank">Digit<&#47;a>. I love saying the name alone. This little app help you save money by pulling tiny amounts out of your account you wouldn't even notice. Which has really been true for me. The biggest amount they have pulled out of my account has been ten dollars so far. I could have easily spent that at Target or somewhere else. What truly is lovely about Digit is it isn't really an app at all. It is a conversation via texts. Although Digit may be a Bot, he&#47;she is a quirky and lovable one. Any app that can make saving money fun whiles talking in animated gifs get my stamp of approval automatically. Also their social media team is on point.</p>
<p>It is also lovely to get a quick text everyday of my current balance in my checking account, and what my last transaction was. I don't need all the sexy graphics, and data analytics on where I am spending my money. I use Mint as well, where I can find and log all of that information. Digit is just a quick catch-me-up, and they do it really well. I wish I could set a savings goal where Digit would let me know when I have reached a certain dollar amount. *wink wink* Looking at you Digit.</p>
<p>My second crush is newer but I think it is going to blossom into a lovely relationship. I just signed up for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;qz.com&#47;" target="_blank">Quartz<&#47;a> this week and really like them. Similar to Digit it is a text conversation about what is happening in the news. Kinda like bumping into a friend on the street going "Hey, what's the latest?" "Holy shit, did you hear about the GOP debate??"</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lingonberrys.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2016&#47;02&#47;IMG_8491.png" rel="attachment wp-att-5755"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5755 size-medium" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.lingonberrys.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2016&#47;02&#47;IMG_8491-169x300.png" alt="IMG_8491" width="169" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Their "headlines" are great if you can call them that. Again... and this might be saying more about me. I love gifs. And they have great graphics and captions to go along with it. They link to the full article is you want it, if not you can just move on. You always get two set responses if you want more information, or move on to the next story. It has become one of the first apps I open in the morning when I wake up.</p>
<p>I think what makes both of these apps so successful if their tone and being able to delight the user. It really hits home that you don't need a lot, just make me laugh. Can that lesson maybe be applied to real life relationships as well? I don't know. But animated gifs definitely helps.</p>
<p>PS. Yes my phone is set in Swedish if that confused any of yall.</p>

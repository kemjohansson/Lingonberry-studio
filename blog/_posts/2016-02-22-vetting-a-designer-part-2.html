  will want to keep you like a shiny penny. We are also a lot of fun to have around

  handed over your budget and Scope of Work. You are now ready to start on this journey
  together. Are you ready to take it to the next level?\r\n"

<h2>Get it in Writing<&#47;h2><br />
Even with all of these new lovey and exciting feelings it is best to get everything in writing. You and your designer should have contract on what is to be produced. It should include a timeline when milestones are to be met; concept sketches, early mockups, refined mockups, revision schedule, and final design. There should also be deadlines for you (yes, you the client Silly) when you are to hand over copy, photos, or anything that applicable to the project. This will be a good reference document through the entire project. The designer should communicate with you what you are responsible for, and what they need to move things forward.</p>
<p>As you move through the project it is good to keep a written record all the feed back between each round. This will help to remind each party what was said and you can make sure all promises are being met. During this time it is good to get the payment schedule out of the way. You probably have already made a deposit or paid in your "kill-fee". This contract and written docs will be essential to you both, especially if things are starting to shift and you feel things are going South. Which brings me to the next point...</p>
<h2>Honor thy Deadline<&#47;h2><br />
This goes both ways. If your designer is waiting for copy&#47;photos to drop in the design the project cannot move forward until that has been supplied. This should also be a no brainer. Know with each milestone missed, it will push your finished project date back. If you promised to provide feedback within 48 hours, then that should be honored. Like I said, this trust goes both ways. Both of you should do your best to meet the dates in the contract and if this is consistently not happening it might be time for a little talk. Personal things can come up and easily get in the way. If you were not able to meet a deadline try to work out a revised timeline and try to keep those incidents to a minimum. Communication is key.</p>
<p>I have had clients send me copy late, often the evening before we agreed to have finished delivered designs. I have also been told of designers who take weeks before getting back to a client with sketches or revisions. Neither is cool. No one likes their time being disrespected. If your designer is not meeting the milestones, remind them of the contract. If they did it right, then there is no reason to miss deadlines. If you are a good client then your designer should do their best to keep everything on schedule. We can talk horror stories later and what to do if things get to that point where you might have to F. I. R. E. Someone.</p>
<h2>Be a good client<&#47;h2><br />
Books can probably be filled on how to be a good client, just like being a good designer. But it is actually quite simple. Just be a nice human being. It goes a long way. That being said if your designer is treating you really good and you want to make sure you are keeping us happy too, read on. The little comic below is great, and shows a few things to avoid.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http:&#47;&#47;thevisualrepublic.com&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;11&#47;Screen-Shot-2012-11-05-at-4.19.36-PM.png" alt="" width="649" height="532" &#47;></p>
<p>[ut_dropcap style="one"] 1 [&#47;ut_dropcap] You don't need to check in with us every day. Good design can take time, and your designer should check in with you every few days as they have sketches, mock-ups etc. Designers need time to figure out the solution, so while it might seem like progress is slow don't be alarmed as long as the milestones are being met. Let them work the problem you have given them. You want us to work on your project more then answering your daily email, phone call, text. Trust me.</p>
<p>[ut_dropcap style="one"] 2 [&#47;ut_dropcap]Trust them. Trust that you have hired the expert that they are, just like you would your doctor or lawyer. Give them room to experiment and create something new. They are creative problem solvers by nature, let them do what they do best. You don't have to accept everything they do as gospel and you should definitely speak up when you feel the project is moving in the wrong direction. We are not mind readers, so tell us if you want something different.</p>
<p>[ut_dropcap style="one"] 3 [&#47;ut_dropcap] Give constructive feedback. Saying simply that you don't like it doesn't help anyone. Try to explain what it is about the design that you don't like. You don't have to feel bad about this, or feel like you have to go about this delicately. We do this for a living, and our skin became pretty thick in a little place called art school. (That could fill another blog post) We won't cry. We won't take it personally. Try to find what parts you want to keep as well. Maybe the typeface is not appropriate for your audience, but the colors, and layout is on point. Giving specifics will help your designer learn what works and what isn't.</p>
<p>Last but not least, and this really should go without saying: pay on time and hold up your end of the deal. Voicing appreciation of the final mockup goes along way. Hopefully you had some fun too, and the two of you will have an ongoing relationship for many beautiful future projects. Thank you for reading!</p>

<h3>About This Project<&#47;h3><br />
What inspired me to write and design this book was my interest in astrology.  I have noticed for some time that the people who were closest to me, were of the same or similar signs.  I found this interesting, since most people usually don&rsquo;t go beyond researching their own sign than reading their horoscope.  Is there something in the orbit of the stars, that make everyone born under that sign similar? The moon which is the closest to Earth, affects the tides, our currents, and weather.  And those are just the physical affects we can see.  What affects do the other planets have on us, that we don&rsquo;t see?  Does that include personality?  </p>
<p>Creating this book I knew I wanted to do a French-fold accordion book.  When displayed it can be assembled into a circle, which goes back to the cycle of the year and seasons.  I choose four different color papers to represent the different elements that is also reflected in the symbols, and images.  Each sign has a woman who I admire in some way, who I also feel personify their sign.  Billy Holiday starts the astrology cycle with Aries, which is also fire, ending with Jean Harlow for Pieces.  The elements that are represented are Fire, Earth, Air, and lastly Water.  The cover has a symbol for the Aquarius waves, and a capital A.  The cover is silk screened on wood, in keeping with the natural elements. </p>
<p>The typeface used inside the book is Garamond, because of its timeless and classic.  The book is hand crafted with the text block sown using brochure stitch.   The pattern on the back of the book is an assembly of the symbols of all of the zodiacs, silk screened on Neenah Paper Natural White 110lb.  Neenah paper is used through the whole book, minus the text blocks and the images.  </p>
<p>The project was personal to me, since I have enjoyed reading about my sign for a long time.  Doing research on the other signs let me learn more about them, and what their traits are.  Each sign has a long history and many dates back to early Etruscan period.  As I learned more about the signs I thought of people I knew who were born of that sign and if it fit.  Often I felt it did.</p>

<p>Periodically I get asked how you go about finding a good designer. I am always flattered since I guess that puts me in the "good" category. Finding and vetting a designer can feel very intimidating. We are these flowy kinda crazy creative people, who are very opinionated on the most bizarre stuff. We also have lots of weird names like; Helvetica, CMYK, smart layers, kerning, and vectors. Lots of people tell me horror stories about designers not completing their work, disappearing, or just generally being terrible. So what do you do?</p>

<h2>Match Made in Design Heaven<&#47;h2><br />
The first thing you should look at when hiring a designer is their portfolio. This should be a no brainer. Their aesthetic has to agree with yours - or at least the thing you are hiring them for. Don't hire a plumber to fix your electricity. We all have different strengths and style. Their portfolio should speak to what kind of designer they are and what their specialty is. Be wary of the designer who can do it all. While it might be true, they might not do any of those things well. This is why their portfolio is so important. They should be able to explain what their process is and how they came to the solution. Keep in mind that while you are hiring them to come up with a creative product - logo, brochure, branding, website, etc. You are also hiring them to be a creative problem solver. You want brains and beauty, baby.</p>
<p>Most designers have a portfolio site. Lots of people are also on <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.behance.net&#47;" target="_blank">Behance<&#47;a> and <a href="https:&#47;&#47;dribbble.com&#47;" target="_blank">Dribble<&#47;a>. The best clients I have gotten were through word of mouth. So ask around first. It is important you can talk and work well together so have an interview before you decide to continue. Sometimes a designer might be swamped (this happens to me). Don't see that as a rejection, I simply don't have the time to take on a new project. If you have some flexibility of when you need the project done by, then tell them. They might be able to work out alternate timeline and take you on as a new client a few weeks down the road. (Word of advice: Don't tell a designer you needed this project done yesterday. It will never win us over to your side, and makes you look bad. We understand everything is super urgent, but still plan accordingly)</p>
<h2>Scope of Work<&#47;h2><br />
This is where you figure out exactly what you need. While you may think you "just" need a logo. Consider where the logo will go. Do you need a business card? Website? Brochure? Then you really need a branding system. The scope of work will help your designer figure out just how many hours to allocate to your project. For me it also helps if I know the big picture and what your goals are before starting on any design. Be honest of the rights you want to have signed over to you when the project is done, such as transfer of intellectual property. Also be sure to tell us if you already have some branding already in place.</p>
<p>Consider the non-designy stuff in your Scope of Work when making your list. For example: I need help figuring out who my audience is. I need User Experience to evaluate my store layout. I need someone to write the copy. This isn't considered "traditional" design, but this will influence the creative solution and your designer will thank you for letting them be involved from the the very start. And knowing my kind, we love this type of problem solving and typically know people we can recommend you to for those other things.</p>
<p>Along with the Scope of Work pull some ideas of what you like. Pinterest is awesome for this. It can be the mood of a photograph, typography, whatever speaks to you. This will help your future designer immensely. We are also naturally very visually people. Showing us pretty pictures is the fastest way to get us excited about a project. It is like catnip for creatives.</p>

<h2>You Get What you Pay For<&#47;h2><br />
I don't know how to stress this enough. There are a ton of discount design sites out there. But don't be the person who has to spend 60 dollars trying to fix a 20 dollar haircut. Or if you do, then know the risk. And no, I am not going to help you fix your logo. As a rule I don't change other peoples designs. Most good designers won't. It is an unspoken rule among creatives. No one wants to see their design bastardized by someone else, although I can tell you it happens all the time.</p>
<p>Along with your Scope of Work you should have a budget allocated to what you can spend. A good designer will know what they are worth and give you a fair price. As a whole most of my clients have been really good about this and been ok with the estimate I have presented. However, I have picked up a few pet peeves along the way though.</p>
<p>[ut_dropcap style="one"] 1 [&#47;ut_dropcap] Don't tell your designer they should work for free in exchange for "word of mouth" advertising. Even though I may score major brownie points with you, they sadly don't accept them when I try to pay my rent, my electricity or buy food at the grocery store. This is my livelihood. Respect it as such.</p>
<p>[ut_dropcap style="one"] 2 [&#47;ut_dropcap] Don't make your designer work on Spec-Work. I understand it is really good for you if I do hours of work for free in "hope" I may get your big job. It also makes it really easy for you cancel the project if you don't like the results and I get left with nothing. This is a relationship based on trust. We both should have some skin in the game sort of speak. Most designers will ask for a deposit, or a "kill-fee". This is in case the project gets cancelled or unfinished, and is a small compensation for the hours I have already put into it.</p>
<p>[ut_dropcap style="one"] 3 [&#47;ut_dropcap] Don't put a VW Bus amount-of-work in a VW Beetle budget. I will price out everything you want under the sky, but in the end your budget will still dictate how much we can get done. I would say with all designers this is negotiable, but be realistic on what you can afford. I have divided up payments in the past. Most designers can set up a payment plan, so it doesn't feel like you have to take out a second mortgage on the house.</p>
<p>One last note of the price for work. Sometimes I get asked if I would ever consider pro bono work. My peers might glare at me in the lunch room for this, but the answer is: yes of course. But it has to be for a cause or thing I feel very passionately about. Or I must really really love you. These projects don't come along very often, and when they do I will take (almost total) creative freedom. These projects are a case by case basis and I am very selective when I take them on.  </p>
<p>This is the end of Part 1! Now with that Scope of Work and budget you are now ready! In Part 2 I will help you to proceed once you find your awesome designer. </p>

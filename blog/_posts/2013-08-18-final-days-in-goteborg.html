<p>I am having a hard time telling where the last three weeks have gone. Needless too say, it has been a great time. I am a little sad to go on Tuesday, but excited for this new chapter and journey I am undertaking. I will miss my family, and it always feels heavy to leave. Especially this time since I don&rsquo;t know when I will see everyone again.</p>
<p>The past few weeks I have done my Sweden Tour which has included Svart&aring;, Storfors and Karlstad. It has been wonderful to see my family and spend some quality time. I have met Alfred Nobel, who is looking really good for his age. I can now tell you why he is really important for Sweden and his history. If it ever comes up on Trivia night, shoot me a text.</p>
<p>This weekend I got to spend some time with mom and Lars. I also got lucky to catch the tail end of the G&ouml;teborg Culture Fest, with Anna and Gustav. We caught the big concert, with lots of different Swedish artists. Picture is below. I got to see Loreen who won the Eurovision contest last year. So that was pretty sweet. Euuuuuuphoria!!!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be packing and trying to figure out how to get everything to the states. It will be interesting, and I am hoping Delta will be lenient. Ha! There is a lot of jam. And books. A few red bricks. Stones and other heavy things. The normal stuff.</p>
<p>I remember daydreaming all of April, may, and June waiting on this vacation. Now it is almost over. Time flies so enjoy every moment you are given. I know I have, and I still have much to look forward to on my road trip out west.</p>
<p>Lina out!!!</p>

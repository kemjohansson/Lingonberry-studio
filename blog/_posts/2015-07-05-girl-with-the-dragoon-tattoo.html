<h3>About this Project<&#47;h3><br />
The initial project for the class was to create a collage, which was to interpret a word that was assigned in class.  The word assigned to me in class was Trauma.  Trauma is defined as a body wound produced by a sudden physical injury either from violence or accident. The experience can produce psychological injury and&#47;or pain. My first collages where images found in magazines, as I created a series of different compositions.  After reflecting on the word further, I decided to move from magazines to newspapers and from color to black & white.  I found this to be more appropriate since newspapers is often filled with events that were traumatic to other people.  When experiencing such a event, your life is often divided into two sections, one before, and one after the event happened. The use of black & white, I felt reflected that.</p>
<p>After experimenting with the collage in Photoshop, I was happy with the end result.  After the first critique in class, I reworked the project and decided to turn it into a book cover. The small newspaper clips, reminded me of the Steig Larsson thriller Millennium book series.  I decided to use the collage for a redesign of the first book in the series &ldquo;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.&rdquo;  The books have been hugely popular in Sweden since they were published in 2006, and are now on the best seller lists around the world. </p>

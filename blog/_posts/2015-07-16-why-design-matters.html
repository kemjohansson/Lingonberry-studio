<p>It is easy to be looking out of your own little design bubble to think: Well of course design matters. But tech and design's marriage was off to a rocky start, as form didn't always follow function. Working in the industry, I feel it is a pretty exciting age where not only does the technology have to work, but also delight and interest the user. I would say design matters more than ever - and there are a few that would agree on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.kpcb.com&#47;blog&#47;why-design-matters-more-than-moore" target="_blank">this<&#47;a>. Technology no longer sells itself. You need design to build brand loyalty, adaptability, and is a key to the success of any product. It cannot afford to be an after thought no longer. Bake it into the DNA of the product, and your users will thank you for it.    </p>
<blockquote><p>Just as you cannot imagine buying a car without design, we have entered an age in which you cannot buy tech without design.<&#47;blockquote></p>

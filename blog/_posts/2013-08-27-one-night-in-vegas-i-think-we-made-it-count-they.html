<p>One night in Vegas. I think we made it count! They had the biggest Chahuly sculpture in the Bellagio that I have ever seen! It was incredibly beautiful. Sadly I had a huge fall out with a pair of close friends. &nbsp;They were just wearing me down, and made the whole night simply unbearable. &nbsp;I thought I could make it through the evening without saying anything, but finally I had to stop and tell Kimberly I had enough. &nbsp;My shoes were slowly tearing&nbsp;my feet right off. &nbsp;We flagged down a guard in MGM Grand and got bandaids. &nbsp;I was probably not the first woman who has broken up with her shoes in a casino, since he had some right in his pocket. &nbsp;Noted for next time.</p>

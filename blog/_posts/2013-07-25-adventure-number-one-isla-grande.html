<p>Day one in Panama and it has been an adventure for sure. The morning was very nice, and started with me trying to figure where I would like to go for a day or so. My thoughts had been that I would go to San Blas but the Universe had other plans for me. Instead I ended up in on a small island called Isla Grande. To say it is remote would be an understatement. But you trade in all common luxuries for a breathtaking view and beauty. The mountains climb right out of the ocean which is a feat considering the size of the waves. Looking out of my little room, massive waves are constantly pounding the shore. The sea breeze and smell is something I have missed dearly. The taxi ride was about two hours. Most of that time was spent with me looking out the window at the mountains. The rest of the time was spent with me and my driver trying understand each other. Lots of single words and bad Spanish. Very bad Spanish. <&#47;p></p>
<p>I am staying at the Sister Moon Hotel, which is at the very end of the island. Looking out I can see the ocean separating us from the mainland. The hotel is cute, with a salt water pool, bar and restaurant. You have to take a shuttle to get here. Which may or may not be piloted by a boy who is not yet in middle school. But do not worry, he will maneuver the boat like a pro and will get you to shore in even the roughest seas. I was incredibly impressed and maybe a little jealous. <&#47;p></p>
<p>I think I might be one of three people staying at this hotel tonight. Two being the hotel staff. I would say it is a stretch to say there are more than five tourists on this whole island. Is you are looking for peace, solitude and hospitality, you will find it here.  <&#47;p></p>
<p>So far I have been getting by on some very rusty Spanish with a light Italian blend. A few people know English, but I try to make an effort to at least try. The thing that caught my off guard today is I really needed more cash when I arrived here. MasterCard is not really accepted and I would say the island is predominantly a cash economy. A slight dilemma if you will. I used the bit of cash I had on the taxi, parking fee and shuttle across. Next time I will know better. But being on an island with a small piece of plastic is pretty much useless.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Thank goodness there are good people all around if you look for them. A man by the name of Carlos told me he will get me back to the mainland tomorrow so I can find an ATM. He owns the hotel Congo, that is complete with an Oceanside restaurant. He told me I could come back there for dinner. After taking two pictures with his uncle, I was told I could have anything I wanted. I thank my good Swedish genes tonight. :) uncle wanted to walk me home but that is where I drew the line. But everyone have been super nice and thoughtful. The hotel staff chased me down to lend me a flashlight for my evening excursion. I am glad I took it since you can&rsquo;t see even you hands in front of you once night falls. <&#47;p></p>
<p>Tomorrow I am off to Portbello to find a cajero autom&aacute;tico. I have an early boat to catch. I am thinking I might spend the night in my hammock. It is so much nicer then a hot room. I am being lulled to sleep by the ocean, some salsa music, and the hammock swaying in the wind. <&#47;p></p>
<p>I always say the trouble with vacation is that is a small glimpse how you want you life to always be. Good night!<&#47;p></p>

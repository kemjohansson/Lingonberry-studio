<p>After having designed and refined UI screens the quest for good prototyping tools have been an interesting ride.&nbsp;I thought I would share some of my favorite tools that I have come across, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-5579"></a> Two small confessions.&nbsp;My background is design. Not code. &nbsp;There are a lot of great tools that can give you full functionality if you know JavaScript or jQuery. If you are like me- drag and drop is more your cup of tea. Secondly, I am still looking for a tool that does everything I am looking for and really love. I have big hopes for the prototyping software <a href="http:&#47;&#47;silverflows.com&#47;" target="_blank">Silverflows<&#47;a> which will let you prototype right in Sketch. They are supposed to launch soon, and I can't wait until they do. Which brings me to a side note:&nbsp;<a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.sketchapp.com&#47;" target="_blank">Sketch<&#47;a>. Everything that I love about Adobe Illustrator, but streamlined for UI design. Highly recommend it. It is a beautiful beautiful little program.</p>
<p><a href="https:&#47;&#47;media.giphy.com&#47;media&#47;OCu7zWojqFA1W&#47;giphy.gif"><img class="alignright" src="https:&#47;&#47;media.giphy.com&#47;media&#47;OCu7zWojqFA1W&#47;giphy.gif" alt="" width="400" height="219" &#47;><&#47;a>Ok, hang on to your butts&nbsp;'cause here we go!</p>
<h2>Invision<&#47;h2><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.invisionapp.com&#47;" target="_blank">Invision<&#47;a> is the prototyping tool I have been using the longest. Everything they do is on point. From their on-boarding, customer support to their newsletters (worth signing up for alone). Even after trying a variety of different tools, I have yet been able to cut the cord with these guys. All image based, you upload all your screens and hot link them together. Super easy. You can even set up templets if you have a million screens (like I do). You can link up to your Slack-feed, Basecamp, Dropbox, or other cool third party platforms. They keep everything up to date. As long as your jpegs have the same file name, all your hot linking will update just fine. No cross-platform weirdness between iOS and Android which is nice. You can collaborate, leave comments, and they just released <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.invisionapp.com&#47;new-features&#47;49&#47;craft-design-with-real-data-in-real-time" target="_blank">Craft<&#47;a>. Which let you plug in real data! I haven't played around with this feature yet, but I plan to. I can report back how it goes. Invision also lets your sign up and have one project on their free plan. After that you do have to pony up some money. But it is enough to let you kick the tires which I like.</p>
<p>A few drawbacks with Invision. It is all cloud based, which is great if you have internet connection. I can't tell you how many times I have tried to show my prototype and had terrible connection. Probably a greater problem because of At&amp;t but it is something to consider. Keep up the small talk as your screens try to load. If you have a lot of really cool and intricate behaviors, with everything being a static image they don't translate. They are adding some cool transitions that you can do but the behaviors is a thing I miss.</p>
<h2>Pixate<&#47;h2><br />
I have played around with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pixate.com&#47;">Pixate<&#47;a> a bit. They are also image based which is good for us non-coders. You can replicate and defining a lot of the behaviors by layering images. They offer some great demos online and tutorial videos. I love the little mobile app that comes with it, that mirrors the app right on your device. It keeps a list of previous versions on top of all your other prototypes. They also allow you to do videos for user feedback which I love. The service is free, and very easy to get up and running on your computer. They aren't browser based which is a perk, because you can mirror your app over a local connection. Pixate also just got picked up by the Google Design team so I am sure there will be some great improvements coming out.</p>
<p>Where things fell apart for me is if you are designing a really complex app with 8-10 different screens with lots of different functionality. It gets confusing very quickly. I gave up after just trying to create a transition from my login screen to my home screen. Full disclosure: I might not be the most patient person. But I do feel this is a great little tool if you have a simple app.</p>
<h2>Origami &amp; Avocado<&#47;h2><br />
This is the latest prototyping software I have found that I am really excited about. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;facebook.github.io&#47;origami&#47;">Origami<&#47;a> is developed by Facebook and plugs right into your Xcode software. So there is a tiny bit of a work around, you do have to sign up as a Apple Developer in order to download the Quartz Composer software. I am usually hard-core against downloading any third-party thing to get to the thing i REALLY want. But I made the exception here. Getting Origami up and running was relatively easy, and plugging into <a href="https:&#47;&#47;vimeo.com&#47;124909596">Avocado<&#47;a> I get to keep the drag and drop functionality that I want. I am just starting out with these guys so I haven't had the chance to really see everything that is under the hood. But I can post a update when I get there.</p>
<h2>Other tools on my horizon<&#47;h2><br />
I found out about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;creolabs.com&#47;" target="_blank">Creo Labs<&#47;a> recently who combine this hybrid design development tool. They seem to target more code minded people, with their own special syntax language called Gravity. Gravity seems to be a combination of Swift and JavaScript, which they developed themselves. I have honestly not played around with these guys so I can't give an honest opinion if they are any good. Their big push is, why prototype when you can go straight into development?</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;framerjs.com&#47;" target="_blank">Framer<&#47;a> is another that is based more on coding. The split screen allows you to see your design update as you change the code. They have a lot of precoded functions in their library already so you don't have to feel super intimidated to code things from scratch. It looks a lot of fun to play around with if I had nothing else to worry about. But what I found true for me is I need speed and efficiency to get my prototype together.</p>
<h2>More lists<&#47;h2><br />
There are so many other tools out there. UX Design Weekly has a great list of tools to check out <a href="http:&#47;&#47;uxdesignweekly.com&#47;ux-resources&#47;prototyping-tools&#47;">here<&#47;a>. My advice is to figure out what works for you and your own work flow. Remember a prototype can be super simple and on paper if you just want to get feed back. Fancy tools are nice, but don't let them get in the way of creating something awesome. Best of luck!</p>

<blockquote>If you can't explain it simply, then you don't know it well enough.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<div class="attribution">Albert Einstein<&#47;div><br />
(Came across this quote as I have been working on a pitch deck all weekend. Feels very appropriate with the discovery of gravity waves this past week which is amazing. Also feels very appropriate while trying to boil a very complex idea down to a few keynote slides.)</p>

<p>Day two of the epic road trip from Atlanta has been amazing. After a good jog on the Arkansas River Trail Kimberly and I checked out of our hotel. We found a sweet little breakfast joint that was enjoyed by the locals. We watched a poor man be put to sleep by a very chatty lady.</p>
<p>We visited the Clinton Library which is located by the river not far from downtown little rock. I looked around for Bill and finally found him helping out in the gifts hop. He is a good man.</p>
<p>After five hours in the cars we made it to Dallas in one piece. Texas is a little bit like I imagined. Lots of highways and lots of cars. We shall see if downtown Dallas is any different.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are visiting the Kennedy Museum.</p>

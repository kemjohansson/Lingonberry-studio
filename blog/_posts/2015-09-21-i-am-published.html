<p>Last week I got to go to Austin with work for their Reach Out and Touch You tour. I was asked to write up the event recap for the company blog which was posted on Friday. Soooo... I am kinda of a big deal now and I am a published author. Hehe. You can check out my full post on the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.dreamhost.com&#47;blog&#47;2015&#47;09&#47;18&#47;reach-out-touch-you-austin-recap&#47;">DreamHost blog<&#47;a>.</p>

<p>So it is the night before I take off and so much is going through my head. The apartment is finally cleaned out and looking spotless. I think it was relatively painless to get it cleaned out, but there is still a lot of stuff. I might have to make some decisions come August.</p>
<p>But I am feeling really good and very excited for my new direction and path. It will be an adventure to say the least. I am down to my last night in Atlanta for a very long time.</p>
<p>So many emotions and thoughts are going through my head. I am gonna try to wind down and see if this brain will shut off. Good night!</p>

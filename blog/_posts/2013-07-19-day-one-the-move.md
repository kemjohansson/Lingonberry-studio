<p>Even though I technically don&rsquo;t leave until Tuesday, today is when stuff really started to move. &nbsp;I can no longer ignore that I set these things into motion, nor do I want to stop them. &nbsp;The time I have waited has finally come. &nbsp;I am moving out. &nbsp;Out of Atlanta. &nbsp;Out of Georgia. Out of the South.<&#47;p></p>

<p>Today my dad came up and picked all the things that I am holding on to. &nbsp;I have tried to cut down to the bare essentials, and the things I hold most dear. &nbsp;In the process I have learned I do not need much to make me happy. &nbsp;The things I will miss the most from this place are:<&#47;p></p>
<p>1. My friends (the new and the old, I could not ask for a better crew)<br &#47;>2. Fox Brothers - it is hard to accept anything else as real BBQ. &nbsp;<br &#47;>3. Dekalb Farmers Market<br &#47;>4. Southern hospitality<br &#47;>5. Blair Crimmins and the Hookers Christmas Concert (which should be an annual thing if it isn&rsquo;t already)<br &#47;>6. Soul food<br &#47;>Alot of it deals with food.. which is one of the things the South does right.&nbsp;<br &#47;><br &#47;>Dear Atlanta, it has been fun. &nbsp;We grew together, and some fun. &nbsp;Made some memories. &nbsp;This is not so much a goodbye, as it is a &ldquo;See yall later&rdquo;.&nbsp;<&#47;p></p>
<p>Dear South, I will be back one day. &nbsp;I am looking at you Charleston. &nbsp;<&#47;p></p>

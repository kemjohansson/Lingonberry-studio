Time has been flying by like crazy, already I have been one week in Sweden. &nbsp;I got really lucky with the weather here, it is has been wonderful. &nbsp;Sunny, warm, and long days with lots of daylight. &nbsp;Can I ask for anything more?</p>
<p>The first few days I stayed in my hometown G&ouml;teborg. &nbsp;But last Saturday I drove up to Karlstad along with my mom to see my sister. &nbsp;She is in the process of moving into a new home, so lots of painting and carrying boxes. &nbsp;It was nice to have the whole family under one roof for once, and working together. &nbsp;It was great to see my nieces, and nephew. &nbsp;I had a few nice quiet nights in my sister&rsquo;s summer cabin, which I spent fishing and reading. &nbsp;My mom and I had a nice night catching up and spending some time together alone.</p>
<p>I spend a few days off the grid, with no internet. &nbsp;Even if it was for just a few days, it felt good. &nbsp;But you can&rsquo;t help but to feel a little odd not checking your email or sending a tweet. &nbsp;I think those breaks are healthy, and much needed. &nbsp;I try not to get glued to my laptop while I am here, but sometimes I get distracted.</p>
<p>Yesterday I arrived at my grandparents. &nbsp;And just like in the fairytales, they live in a small village out in the woods. &nbsp;Luckily I don&rsquo;t have to leave breadcrumbs to find it. &nbsp;The house looks the way I remember it in my childhood. &nbsp;Today we went to an antique store and went shopping. &nbsp;They were also very excited about a dollar store that had opened up close by. &nbsp;I was a bit skeptic, until we walked in. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t a Dollar General, and the place was pretty big. &nbsp;I would compare it more to a Walmart, which is still a little depressing. &nbsp;But I found a few swedish audio books which will be good for my road trip. &nbsp;The antique store was my favorite. Also among my purchases were a few books on Swedish history, and old handmade Swedish pottery. &nbsp;I arrived with only a carry on, so I know I will be able to pack it with me. &nbsp;Hopefully everything will make it back to the States safely.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am making jam! &nbsp;Vi ses!</p>

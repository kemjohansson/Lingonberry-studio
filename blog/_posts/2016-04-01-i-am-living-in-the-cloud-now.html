excerpt: "There has been a few big changes afoot in the past few weeks. It hit me
  yesterday that we are already into April! People always like to say they are living
  life in the fast line. If that is the case I feel like I am in warp speed. But the
  big news is I have transitioned over to a new team! This week is my first week as
  the new designer for Cloud. I am happy to report I am very happy, and we are working
  on some big things! Stay tuned for a pretty big DreamHost announcement today!  I
  will link to it once it is live. \r\n\r\n"

<p>There has been a few big changes afoot in the past few weeks. It hit me yesterday that we are already into April! People always like to say they are living life in the fast line. If that is the case I feel like I am in warp speed. But the big news is I have transitioned over to a new team! This week is my first week as the new designer for Cloud. I am happy to report I am very happy, and we are working on some big things! Stay tuned for a pretty big DreamHost announcement today!  I will link to it once it is live. </p>

<p>I have been brushing up on my HMTL&#47;CSS skills this week, since it is easy to get rusty. I have been gaining a whole new appreciation for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jekyllrb.com&#47;" target="_blank">Jekyll<&#47;a>, which is the a beautiful system for creating static sites and blogs. If you haven't played around with it, and would like to design some really genius and stunning sites that can scale quickly - this platform is legit. Faster then any CMS site that has to read off a database, but still blog aware. In the next few weeks I am looking to simplify my portfolio site down quite a bit, but keep my blog in WordPress. I will keep you posted on my progress.  </p>
<p>If you are looking to learn more, and get into the basics I came across this <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI">web series<&#47;a> during my search. This is the tutorial I am following along for my portfolio site. Until next time kids, peace!     </p>

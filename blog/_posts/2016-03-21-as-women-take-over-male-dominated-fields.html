<p><a title="Women Take" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nytimes.com&#47;2016&#47;03&#47;20&#47;upshot&#47;as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html">By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER | MARCH 18, 2016<&#47;a></p>
<p>After my last <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lingonberrys.com&#47;women-in-technology&#47;">post<&#47;a> it felt like I had to post this kinda discouraging New York Times article I came across over the weekend. When women do move into a male dominated field; including design and biologists wages drop. There is still a huge gender bias alive an well that when a job is done by a woman it is simply not as valued.</p>

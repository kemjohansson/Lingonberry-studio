  favorite design talk in history. I re-watch it every few months as a potent reminder
  why I am doing what I am doing. As a designer we have a responsibility to our craft,
  and what we put out in the world. Don't undermine the design community by not caring
  what you put out into the world. Be the Gatekeepers and Creative Problem Solvers
  we are hired to be. Mike Monteiro really nails the complacency in the design industry
  right on the head.  You can't help but to feel humbled, empowered, and angry at
  the same time.    \r\n\r\n"

<p>This is probably my all-time favorite design talk in history. I re-watch it every few months as a potent reminder why I am doing what I am doing. As a designer we have a responsibility to our craft, and what we put out in the world. Don't undermine the design community by not caring what you put out into the world. Be the Gatekeepers and Creative Problem Solvers we are hired to be. Mike Monteiro really nails the complacency in the design industry right on the head.  You can't help but to feel humbled, empowered, and angry at the same time.    </p>

<p>The path to recovery that Mike recommends:<br />
1. Destroy your Ego.<br />
2. Destroy your Fear.<br />
3. Destroy your Apathy.<br />
4. Destroy Petty Authority.<br />
4. Destroy the Voice Inside.<br />
5. Destroy Misogyny.</p>
<p>I highly recommend his book <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Design-Job-Mike-Monteiro&#47;dp&#47;1937557049&#47;ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437772766&sr=8-1&keywords=Design+as+a+job">Design as a Job<&#47;a> and wish I had read it years ago. It truly should be required reading for all design students.</p>
<p>Another good book that made me re-evaluate my place in the design industry is a little book by David B. Berman <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Do-Good-Design-Change-World&#47;dp&#47;032157320X&#47;ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437772740&sr=8-1&keywords=Do+good+design">Do Good Design<&#47;a>. Both both tickled the higher calling and passion why I choose to go into design to begin with. </p>
<blockquote><p>The work you choose to accept defines you. Consider how those choices accumulate over time.<&#47;blockquote>

<p>Today started of in Dallas, with the longest day of driving ahead of us. We squirreled our breakfast buffet, to help us along on our trip. We tour down town Dallas to see Dealey Plaza which has been on my list for a very long time. It felt strange to finally see a place I have gotten to know so well from the JFK Assassination. The museum was interesting but the content was pretty edited.</p>
<p>Leaving Dallas Kimberly and I drive for a good hour and half before finally leaving suburbia. The forest of chain restaurants and crappy apartments finally started to fade away.</p>
<p>We stopped at a few little towns along the way. One very strange antique store comes to mind. After six hours of driving in TX, we finally crossed into New Mexico. I have learned that Texas is pretty freaking big.</p>
<p>The landscape is breathtaking. From the grassland we arrived up into the plateaus and mountains. It really does look like the Wild West movies.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are off to see Santa Fe and the continue on to Flagstaff. Nite!</p>

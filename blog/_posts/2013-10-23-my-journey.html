<h3>About This Project<&#47;h3><br />
This project was originally a class assignment.  The dialogue I choose is from one of my favorite movies Juno.  The dry humor and, very frank tone of the head character is personified in this part of the movie, where she explains to her best friend that she is pregnant.  The dialogue is over the phone, but is still very illustrative and full of imagery.  The characters are still in high school, which is why I felt the notebook paper was appropriate.  Similar to the passing of a note in class, the type is a blend of doodles and script type.</p>
<p>The movie is a comedy, and I hope my project does embody that as well.  The typefaces used are very hand drawn, to blend better with the hand drawn doodles.  Pointy is the typeface that is used in the movie poster, and used sparingly.  It is hand drawn with a 3D effect to it. The typeface that is used the most is called 2Dumb, and was downloaded from dafont.com. To differentiate the two voices of the character I used opposite colors blue, and orange.  Animation is used to emphasize certain parts of the dialogue, and add humor. The notebook paper turns and gets folded as the dialogue goes on.   Just like a real note, the paper slowly fills up with text as well.The animation was created in Flash CS5, with 30 frames per second.</p>

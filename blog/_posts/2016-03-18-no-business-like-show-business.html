<p>I have been a life long movie fan, but it is really only recently I've gained a new appreciation for classic movies. I remember growing up watching Mary Poppins (still my favorite movie of all time), and of course all the classic animated Disney films. But seeing all the movie remakes, reboots and sequels coming out at the box office lately, I haven't been visiting the movie theater as often as I used to. Instead I have slowly been working my way through <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.imdb.com&#47;chart&#47;top" target="_blank">IMDB's 250 top movies<&#47;a> of all time and have been uncovering some truly amazing gems.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see the evolution of title sequences and typography within film. Heavy hitters like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.artofthetitle.com&#47;designer&#47;saul-bass&#47;" target="_blank">Saul Bass<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.artofthetitle.com&#47;designer&#47;maurice-binder&#47;" target="_blank">Maurice Binder<&#47;a> immediately comes to mind. Saul with his kinetic typography and &ldquo;making the ordinary extraordinary&rdquo;, I don't think a Hitchcock film would be complete without him.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_5692" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lingonberrys.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2016&#47;02&#47;intolerance.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5692"><img class="wp-image-5692 size-medium" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.lingonberrys.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2016&#47;02&#47;intolerance-300x224.jpg" alt="intolerance" width="300" height="224" &#47;><&#47;a> Intolerence (1916)[&#47;caption]</p>
<p>Looking back at early films, I love the experimentation and playfulness. It is easy when the medium is new, but you really feel the film makers pushing the boundaries of what could be done. But something I hadn't considered was the evolution and&nbsp;purpose of the title slide. I used to always wonder why the opening credits were so long. During the silent film era the title slide along with the letter cards was hugely important to give context what the viewer was seeing. There was a studio Lettering Artist, who's sole responsibility was to do typography. I kinda wish Hollywood still had a typography guru on staff so we didn't end up with stuff like&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.companyfolders.com&#47;blog&#47;worst-movie-posters-design-lessons" target="_blank">this<&#47;a>. &nbsp;Also in the early days we have frames! Like you would have for any piece of art, so I see the logic... I guess. I get a kick that the director's name in "Intolerance" is listed on screen four different ways. I guess the ego of Hollywood was strong even back then.</p>
<p>I feel it isn't until the 1930's we get what we would consider the more modern title sequences. Eventually the open title sequence was used to set the mood of the movie and to go along with the subject matter. This is where it gets fun. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.imdb.com&#47;title&#47;tt0028010&#47;?ref_=nv_sr_2" target="_blank">My Man Godfrey<&#47;a> (1936) in the example above is one of my favorite early films. I love the Art Deco buildings in the background. Similar to what was going on in the graphic design world there is a pendulum back and forth between hard-drawn fonts to more modern san-serifs. It is easy to see the correlation between film and what was going on in the art and advertising world.</p>

<p>It is hard to narrow down a few of my personal favorite opening credits. Certainly my design heroes get ranked pretty high. <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=T0bVqgBSZHk" target="_blank">Fahrenheit 451<&#47;a>'s spoken credits give me goose bumps since it directly aligns with the message and content of living in a world with no books. The opening credits for <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=8Bk-t61rGNk" target="_blank">Thank you for Smoking<&#47;a> is pretty great with its integration of smoking advertising.  Actually all of the opening credits for Jason Reitman's movies are excellent if you haven't seen them.  </p>
<p>If you don't know where to start for classic movies check out my list below. I highly recommend all of them!  Don't let a little black and white scare you away. Subtitles can be fun too. I have a list if you would like to combine foreign and B&#47;W together if you wanna get a little crazy. For now, I am going to drop the mic right here.  </p>

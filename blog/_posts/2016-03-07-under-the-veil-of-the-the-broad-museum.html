<p>I ride past this building every day on my way to work and from the outside it looks a bit like a giant Jambox portable speaker. Seeing them putting the finishing touches on the construction and then finally unveiling the final museum was fun to watch over the summer&#47;early fall. It took me a couple of months, but I was able to score tickets in time for my birthday last month and I loved this building more then I had imagined.</p>

<p>From the outside you don't imagine there is a lot of light let into the building with it's honeycomb web. It looks more like a protective armour then an inviting space to view art. But the inside was incredibly beautiful as the long dark staircase takes you up to the top floor exhibit. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lingonberrys.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2016&#47;03&#47;IMG_8300.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-5797"><img class="alignright wp-image-5797 size-medium" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.lingonberrys.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2016&#47;03&#47;IMG_8300-e1457384742379-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_8300" width="225" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>The art inside is beautiful and it wasn't until I was on the top floor I understood the web surrounding structure. The honeycomb structure filters indirect daylight into the building to the point spotlights aren't really needed.  The are no distractions from the art, not even a busy cityscene that you would have seen through regular windows. The veil as it has been called filters all the distractions from the city out and you are left to take in Jeff Koons giant sized ballon dog, Barbara Kruger and Jean-Michel Basquiat.</p>
<p>The museum is a beautiful contrast to the Walt Disney Concert Hall that is right next to it.  Both built to enhance and accentuate art in their own different ways. Disney Hall was built for acoustics and music which I feel is beautifully reflected in its ribbon like architecture. The Broad enhances the visual art inside of it, leaving you in a large naturally lit open space. It felt different from most art museums I have been too, where you have to maneuver around ropes and tight corners. It doesn't feel cramped at all.  </p>

<p>I am looking forward to the summer and the unveiling of the new Cindy Sherman exhibit that is being set up. Should be fun to see. Summer in LA is one of my favorite seasons, especially with the Hollywood Bowl season soon in full swing. Good art. Great music. Done.       </p>

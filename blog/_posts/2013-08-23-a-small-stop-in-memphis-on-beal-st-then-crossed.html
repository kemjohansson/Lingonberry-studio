<p>After an early start Kimberly and I left Atlanta behind us at 7am. &nbsp;Tutu is packed up to the rim, but everything fit fine. &nbsp;I thought I would need a car top carrier, but in the end, Tutu pulled through and fit all my stuff nicely. After crossing into Alabama, we stopped for some breakfast. &nbsp;We had a nice picnic at the Visitors Center, with sandwiches, eggs, yogurt, and coffee. Kimberly wanted me to point out that I made us an awesome breakfast, with sandwiches that lasted through lunch. &nbsp;<&#47;p></p>
<p>The day couldn&rsquo;t have gone any more perfect. &nbsp;Leaving Birmingham, we crossed into Mississippi, and it was interesting to see the country side change before our eyes. &nbsp;We came up into the soft rolling mountains in Alabama, and Mississippi. After we passed Memphis to Arkansas crossing the Mississippi river, the river delta stretched as far the eye could see. &nbsp; It reminded me a little bit of Florida, without the palm trees, and more farm land.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Memphis was great. &nbsp;We briefly stopped at Graceland, which was tight on its security. &nbsp;We couldn&rsquo;t even walk up the the house without a 30 dollar ticket. &nbsp;Since neither of us, loved the King that much, we took as many cheesy pictures as we could while there instead. &nbsp;The tour then continued to Sun Studio, which is were the King recorded his hits. &nbsp;It was fun to see the small building, and make our way downtown. &nbsp;On Beal St, I enjoyed some of the best BBQ wings I have had in my life. &nbsp;Which is a pretty strong statement, but I do not joke about BBQ. &nbsp;After some delicious good southern we crossed into Arkansas. &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p><span>We made it into Little Rock, and have checked into our hotel. &nbsp;Tomorrow we are off to the Clinton P<&#47;span>residencial<span>&nbsp;Library, and then Dallas!&nbsp;<&#47;span><&#47;p></p>

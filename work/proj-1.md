title: DreamHost Cloud Landing Page
---
<p><strong>1. Original landing page for the two cloud products.</strong></p>
<p>After doing research on the users the initial landing page for Cloud was having users make a decision on which product they wanted without much of an introduction.  The page was also very dark, and not very welcoming. The goal of the new page was to better unify the two products and help users understand how easy it is to launch a server.  The second goal was to offer a better overview of how Cloud works while eliminating an extra click to another landing page.</p>

<p><strong>2. Initial Wireframe and Mockup</strong></p>
<p>In the initial mockups I wanted to help users understand our product with user cases. After our user research we discovered our primary audience uses the product as a testing playground or for their business.  I hopped to explain the flexibility and reliability on top of our regular specs. It was a clear choice to showcase the back panel to display how easy it is to launch a server. However, that had to be shelved for a later version of the site.</p>

<p><strong>3. Initial page at relaunch of the DreamHost cloud page</strong></p>
<p>The first version of the revisioned Cloud overview page.  Later versions would include a expanded support section, and a detailed user features.</p>
